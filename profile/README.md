# Unipay: Redefining Payments with Yield-Bearing Stablecoins

Unipay is a multi-chain payment protocol that offers a decentralized and yield-bearing stablecoin solution, **USDu**, designed to replace reliance on traditional banking systems. Alongside USDu, Unipay powers a globally accessible payment ecosystem through its credit-driven payment instruments and settlement layers.

Unipayâ€™s stablecoin, **USDu**, is a scalable, yield-generating, and stable solution for decentralized payments and credit issuance. Built on Solana and leveraging delta-neutral hedging strategies, USDu ensures a stable peg backed by dynamic multi-asset collateral. The stablecoin is fully transparent and interoperable across CeFi and DeFi ecosystems.

USDu stability is maintained through advanced delta-neutral hedging against collateral assets such as staked SOL, ETH, and BTC. Beyond stability, Unipay introduces the **Unipay Card**, a crypto-native credit card that allows users to bridge on-chain stablecoins with real-world payments, including Visa and PayPal transactions.

Through these innovations, Unipay combines the yield derived from staking rewards, perpetual market funding spreads, and efficient collateral management to create a decentralized, scalable, and user-centric financial system.
